# TUPPENCE FAQ

1. What is Tuppence?

- Tuppence is my answer to, "If there were such a thing as tuple-oriented programming, what might it look like?"
- Not that anyone asked, but Tuppence is also my two cents on language design. Or two pence, aka tuppence.

2. No really, what is it?

- Tuppence is a functional programming language inspired by Elm, Go and Ruby. It aims to have the safety of Elm, the compiled-to-native speed of Go and the friendliness of Ruby.
